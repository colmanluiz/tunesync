# Playlist Sync Application - Frontend Development Guide

## Project Overview

You are tasked with rebuilding the frontend for a playlist synchronization application that allows users to sync their playlists across major music streaming services (Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Deezer). This is an MVP for a future SaaS product with AI-powered music recommendations.

## Project Principles

### 1. Learning-First Development

This project serves as a portfolio piece and learning platform for Luiz Colman. Key aspects:

- Focus on understanding concepts before implementation
- Document learning processes and decisions
- Explore and experiment with new technologies
- Break down complex problems into learning opportunities
- Encourage discussion and exploration of alternative solutions

### 2. Mobile-First Design

As a music streaming service companion:

- Design and develop with mobile as the primary platform
- Implement responsive design starting from mobile breakpoints
- Ensure touch-friendly interfaces
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Consider offline capabilities and poor network conditions

### 3. Production-Ready Standards

Although an MVP, maintain high standards for production readiness:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper documentation
- Monitoring and logging
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Code quality tools integration
- Accessibility compliance

### 4. Development Philosophy

- Guide rather than solve: Explore solutions together
- Document decision-making processes
- Create learning opportunities in complex features
- Encourage best practices while maintaining flexibility
- Balance learning objectives with production quality

## Development Approach

4. **Future-Proof Structure**: Plan for AI features and scaling
5. **Experiment & Iterate**: Try new design ideas, gather feedback, refine
6. **Mobile-First**: Design and develop with mobile as primary platform
7. **Learning-Focused**: Document and understand each implementation decision
